## Mechanics

### Character Starter Relic
$\color[RGB]{139,0,0} Anguish$: Deal double damage when below 50% HP. <br />

### Keywords
$\color[RGB]{255,255,0} Lifesteal$: Heal for unblocked damage dealt by this card. <br />
$\color[RGB]{255,255,0} Discover$: Choose 1 of 3 random cards to add to your hand. Will not show healing cards. <br />

### Playstyle
Self-inflicted damage and max HP loss. <br />
Risk reward between losing HP to be more powerful and gaining health to stay alive. <br />
Uses cards from all other colors (through discovering).


## Art
All art was done by AI. <br />
Predominantly using Dall E: https://openai.com/dall-e-2/
### Theme
The theme was inspired by Darkest Dungeon's Flagellant character. <br /> 
There is dark and bloody theme with religious phrasing and imagery. <br />
Ideally the character should feel like self punishment is the way to get stronger.
