## Art
All art was done by AI. <br />
Predominantly using Dall E: https://openai.com/dall-e-2/

### Theme
The theme was inspired by [Darkest Dungeon's Flagellant character.](https://darkestdungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Flagellant) <br /> 
There is dark and bloody theme with religious phrasing and imagery. <br />
Ideally the character should feel like self punishment is the way to get stronger.
